# Bike Rental Prediction using Linear Regression

This is a simple machine learning project where I used **Linear Regression** to predict daily bike rental counts based on weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed) and whether it is a weekday or weekend.

I created this project after learning about **linear regression** to practice my skills and build a small but complete machine learning pipeline.

## Project Overview

- Performed basic exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Built and trained a linear regression model
- Evaluated model performance using MSE and RÂ² Score
- Visualized real vs predicted values
- Saved the trained model as a `.pkl` file
